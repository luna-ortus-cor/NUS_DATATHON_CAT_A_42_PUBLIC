# NUS DATATHON 2025 CAT A TEAM 42

This is a project on developing a model that recommends the best financial advisors for customers.

The folder contains the following:
1. README.pdf
2. requirements.txt
3. CAT_A_42.ipynb
4. CAT_A_42_REPORT

Before running the code, upload the datasets into the folder and ensure that you have downloaded everything in 'requirements.txt' as they are required to run the code and reproduce our results. Run the code chunks in chronological order and refer to our report for further analysis.

Our solution, on average, managed to successfully predict 19.88/31 ideal agent features per client, with the predicted values of continuous features differing from the actual values by less than 0.025. However,  what modelling does not account for are intangible aspects of human relationships which, while difficult to include, can further increase the accuracy of predictions.
